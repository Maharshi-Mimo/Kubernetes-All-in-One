# Kubernetes Compliance and Audit

## Compliance Frameworks Implementation

Kubernetes environments often need to adhere to various compliance frameworks. Here are key implementation strategies:

### SOC 2 Compliance
- Implement access controls using RBAC
- Enable encryption at rest for etcd
- Configure network policies for pod isolation
- Regular security assessments and updates

### HIPAA Compliance
- Enable audit logging for all cluster operations
- Implement data encryption in transit and at rest
- Use namespaces for workload isolation
- Regular backup and disaster recovery testing

## Security Benchmarks

### CIS Kubernetes Benchmark
1. Control Plane Components
   - Secure API server configurations
   - Enable audit logs
   - Restrict access to etcd

2. Worker Nodes
   - Secure kubelet configurations
   - Disable anonymous authentication
   - Configure TLS for all components

### NIST Guidelines
- Follow NIST SP 800-190 for container security
- Implement NIST SP 800-53 controls
- Regular vulnerability scanning
- Secure CI/CD pipeline integration

## Audit Logging Best Practices

### Audit Policy Configuration
```yaml
apiVersion: audit.k8s.io/v1
kind: Policy
rules:
- level: Metadata
  resources:
  - group: ""
    resources: ["pods", "services"]
```

### Best Practices
1. Log Storage
   - Use persistent storage for audit logs
   - Implement log rotation
   - Configure adequate retention periods

2. Log Monitoring
   - Set up centralized logging
   - Use log analysis tools
   - Configure alerts for suspicious activities

3. Performance Considerations
   - Configure appropriate log levels
   - Use log sampling for high-traffic clusters
   - Monitor log storage capacity

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Configure audit logging
