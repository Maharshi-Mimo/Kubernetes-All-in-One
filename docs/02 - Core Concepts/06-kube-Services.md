# Kubernetes Services 


- In Kubernetes, a Service exposes a network application running as one or more Pods in your cluster.
- Key aim:
  - No need to modify your existing application for an unfamiliar service discovery mechanism.
- You can run code in Pods:
  - Designed for a cloud-native world.
  - Older containerized apps.
- A Service makes the set of Pods available on the network for client interaction.
