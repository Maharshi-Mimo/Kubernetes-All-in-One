# Namespaces

In this section, we will take a look at **`Namespaces`**

We have created **`Objects`** such as **`PODs`**, **`Deployments`** and **`Services`** in our cluster. Whatever we have been doing we have been doing in a **`NAMESPACE`**.
- This namespace is the **`default`** namespace in kubernetes. It is automatically created when kubernetes is setup initially.
